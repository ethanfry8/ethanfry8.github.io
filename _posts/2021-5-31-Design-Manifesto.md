5 Principal Ideals
1. Put users first
2. Be open-minded and don’t shut down ideas
3. Learn from mistakes
4. Think through ideas before designing them
5. Be ambitious

  
  When it comes to accessibility within designs, putting your users as the top priority is the key to success. If your users are being catered to, and 
  you are actively listening to their feedback and their advice, your design will be successful. But, it still is important to have your own separate agenda 
  with your own ideas and additions to your design so that you can apply your agenda and also mix in the agenda of your users. From playing a game like Fortnite 
  which has tons of feedback on their updates, it is quite clear that they have decided to ignore their users feedback when updating their game. As a result, the 
  user base is decreasing because users simply aren’t receiving parts of their agenda in the design of the video game. So, from seeing this result first hand in 
  one of the biggest video games in the world, I believe that this further proves that making sure to make your users the number one priority for your design is 
  imperative. Furthermore, in terms of a personal code of ethics, being open-minded and not shutting ideas down is essential to a design. Although you may think 
  somebody’s idea is ridiculous or not possible, it is still important to take it into account and respect their idea. Furthermore, instead of rejecting the idea 
  instantly, you should understand where a co-developer is coming from and why they think their idea is important for the success of the design. But, if you have 
  heard the idea and its details, and you firmly believe that it is not beneficial or even possible for the design, then you should speak up and give reasons for 
  why you think the idea wouldn’t work. Learning from mistakes is another essential part to a successful design because throughout your design there are going to 
  be mistakes in every step whether that is at the lowest fidelity level, or the highest fidelity level, mistakes are always going to be made. But, you should not 
  dwell upon these mistakes, and instead you should rectify them and learn from them most importantly. And after you learn from these mistakes try and apply this 
  new found knowledge to your design later or a future design. Furthermore, thinking through ideas is also important within the design process because it will lead 
  to less mistakes and a smoother design process. As a team, you should have meetings for coming up with ideas, and also meetings for going through the ideas your 
  team came up with so that you can determine the viable ideas and the non-viable ideas. After you determine these ideas, you can design them and apply them to 
  your overall design. This part of the design is essential because it saves tons of time to not waste time on non-viable ideas, and instead spend time making sure 
  the viable ideas are well-developed and thought out. Lastly, being ambitious with your design is the key to it being unique and appealing to users. If you aren’t
  ambitious enough, your design will most likely be boring and plain, and nobody is ever going to want to use it. So, I believe that starting off with a bunch of 
  ambitious ideas is a great way to start off so you can determine what ideas are too ambitious, just ambitious enough, and not ambitious enough. As a result, 
  starting off with these big and ambitious ideas leads to successful designs. All of these 5 main principles are what it takes to create successful designs. 
  
  Now, I am going to be talking about these 5 principles and how they were applied in our year-long design called HM Comms. Firstly, putting our users first was  pretty much the approach to accessibility we had all year as we had many usability tests with users all over our campus, and from a wide variety of students. 
 For our first three tests, we used our paper prototype, and we would go through our pages and ask each user for their genuine thoughts on each slide, and we encouraged them to say whatever came to their mind as each comment would help our design even more.

  For our design, we tried to use a hub and spoke model to the best of our ability, as each task that was trying to be completed by our design would always loop       back to our main page. Then, we did a digital prototype check in with revised changes from our paper prototype and again had a similar interview process to the     first three usability tests. These tests allow	ed us to put user’s ideas and feedback at the top of our priority, and most of the feedback we implemented and it     did significantly improve our design. Furthermore, when we first started brainstorming our ideas for the year, we had multiple meetings where we just simply went   through ideas that everyone would have, and we would even try to mix certain ideas together to create a better design. During these meetings, all three of the       people in our group were highly optimistic and never shut down ideas which led to an extremely successful final design that we have now with our digital      prototype.

  Furthermore, in our paper prototype, we had many gaps in our design as some buttons wouldn’t lead to another page.
  
  ![BadPage](https://github.com/ethanfry8/ethanfry8.github.io/blob/b5b0d9f80f6738f2f61d47b95247ede58630132f/PaperPrototype1.png)
  
  This is a prime example of this issue, so we learned from this mistake, and rectified it in the final design by adding another page that would show the club rooms. And this is the slide that fixed the issue from the paper prototype.

  Before we started designing anything, we had months of preparation and thinking through our ideas before we started designing.
  We went through multiple stages of learning about design tactics like surveys, interviews, usability tests, and more which all led us to more informed decisions. 
  Furthermore, we went through all of our ideas and made sure they were possible, yet creative. Lastly, our team was extremely ambitious when we started the design
  process as we firstly wanted to create a whole map of our campus and allow people to see where their own club meeting for that day was. Also, we wanted to create
  a reward system for filling out polls, and we also wanted to even make answering polls mandatory. These ideas were great, but they weren’t viable, so we weren’t able
  to implement them, but we were being ambitious which was important because it did lead to some very unique and creative designs like having each club have their 
  individual polls and meetings page. By using these 5 principles in our own design, we were able to have a very successful outcome.
  
  In conclusion, I think that our 5 principal ideas which are extremely useful and pertinent to creating successful designs, I think can go even further than design and can be applied to life long ideals. For our first ideal, putting users first can be interpreted as putting your close ones first whether that is your friends or family, and making sure you have a small circle of people, so you know who is truly your family. Secondly, in whatever situation or job you are in, you always have to be open-minded as it is a quality that eveyrone values heavily, and it will make you a better, smarter, and more friendly person which will lead to great success in all aspects of life. Furthermore, learning from mistakes is extremely important because if you don't make mistakes in the first place you will never know what is right and what is wrong. Also, learning from these wrongdoings allows you to realize the right thing to do, and apply that to your future. Thinking through ideas is another big life lesson that can be greatly useful as ideas that have thought will always be successful, and you will be using your time to the maximum efficiency. Lastly, being ambitious is probably the most important principle that I have listed because if you are not ambitious, you will be unhappy. But, if you are ambitious an follow your goals and dreams, you will be happy, and when you are happy, you will be successful in your own right. All of these 5 principles have many uses, and following them can lead to a successful design, idea, or overall life.
