Grouping of In-person school observations

A:
Playing sports is pretty much impossible as you can’t get much closer than 6 feet and you need to use a mask which makes it hard to breath
No clubs are running in person which ruins the experience of a lot of them
Some classes like P.E and also labs are more difficult as you can’t get close to each other



E = Campus and classes:
People aren’t social distancing
People touch each other pretty often and interact with each other in less than 6 feet.
Barriers on desks are never used because you can’t see board with them


I:
People can’t hear each other through barriers and masks
Meetings with teachers are difficult as interaction is tough


O: 
Seats near robotics lab with no support for your back.
Barriers make it so you can’t hear board
Seats in Tillinghast has no cushion

U = Students and teachers:
Environment is uncomfortable for students and teacher because of Covid-19 and the in-school experience isn’t the same
Some teachers and students are online which makes classes tough as there are people in-person and online
People feel differently than others in terms of Covid making it hard to please everybody in their own ways
Going remote is an option, but it is clearly worse.

Grouping of Online school observations:

A:
Clubs go online for everybody
Sports aren’t an option
Labs for sciences are impossible to do online
Tests and quizzes are harder to proctor and detect for cheating online
Classes happen way less often
Have to do Asynchronous assignments to make up for it


E = Zoom classes:
Zoom classroom is much more dull and doesn’t create the environment of a real classroom at all
People seem to be slacking off during class, and not paying attention
Different home environments making some kids uncomfortable being in school at home


I:
Students and teachers feel disconnected from each other
Kids don’t see each other and as a result lose all social interaction with each other.
People can turn off cameras, making interaction even worse.


O:
People have different equipment at home making online school more difficult for different students
Some people don’t have much space to work at home.
Internet access for different people can cause issues with online class


U = Students, teachers:
Can’t see friends
Seems much less focused and motivated online.
Don’t try as hard in school
On phone pretty often from looking at different people


Part 2:

For the past 2 weeks in online school, I have been observing students and teachers in online school, and for the rest of the school year in which we have been in-person, I have been observing people, our campus, and all of the problems in both. Online school seems to have more issues with students paying attention, being motivated, being prevented from cheating, having problems at home with online school, and not being as diligent as they usually are. In-person school seems to have more Covid related issues this year like not being able to hear people through barriers and masks, not social distancing, being uncomfortable in school, not having fun activities like sports and clubs, etc. Both online and in-person schools have their own separate problems that make life harder for students, but there is a lot to learn from these problems like how they could be fixed, improved, or maybe are unable to change at all.
In terms of in-school observations, the ones I want to talk about the most are the students not social distancing, not being able to see through masks or hear through barriers, the uncomfortable environment, and the inability to do outside activities like sports and clubs. First, the students not social distancing is a huge problem at HM. It is a huge problem because it is really unable to be enforced as the teacher to student ratio is pretty great, so there aren’t enough teachers around all the students to always tell them to stay 6 feet apart, and not touch. As a result, people touch each other all day, and with how easily the virus spreads, it will be easily transmitted. To be completely honest, maintaining social distancing in the HM community is practically impossible, but the best we can do is regulating ourselves, and reminding ourselves to do it for our community to make sure we can stay in school. Another huge problem is the inability to hear through both masks and barriers. Everybody knows that the mask muffles your voice and there tends to be another layer of this with the barriers. For example, in my chemistry class, my teacher is often unable to hear students’ answers to questions and as a result it makes the class a lot harder for them to teach and interact with students. Furthermore, in my history class, a girl in the front row speaks at a pretty low volume and as a result I can never hear her because of the masks and barriers which means I might miss a point that is pretty crucial to our discussion. Furthermore, the environment of the school is not how it usually is. In the era of Covid, people don’t feel safe at school and that is reflected on the mood of people at the school, as I have multiple friends who would rather be doing online school because of how different school is when last year, nobody wanted to go online. Also, teachers are in a weird spot at school where they have to cater to both students that are remote and in-person which makes them uncomfortable because it is impossible to balance the attention to all students. Lastly, I wanted to talk about clubs and sports outside of our normal days at school. As people at HM, we all know that clubs are canceled and sports are being run, but not in the normal way. These are both big problems as clubs and sports are ways for people to get their stress out of their head and do something they are passionate about and enjoy, what has happened with Covid is that it has destroyed this aspect of school and as a result people have not much to look forward to. Also, sports are still somewhat running which is great, but I have heard you have to wear a mask and follow a lot of other regulations along with not being able to play other schools which kind of makes the experience worse for athletes. All of the observations that I talked about seemed to be related to Covid which reveals how it has affected our school so greatly, and how it has produced many problems. 
Also, throughout the 2 weeks in which we went online, I also made a lot of observations like more cheating on assessments, dull classroom environment, students not paying attention, motivation being lowered, little to no social interaction, and issues with equipment for online school. First, there is clearly more access to cheating online as there is no real way in which the teachers and the administration can stop a student from cheating. Therefore, people don’t take tests and quizzes how they should be, and as a result they aren’t testing their knowledge, but instead reading off of worksheets. There is no real solution to this either than using a software that might be able to prevent cheating or for the students to adhere to the honor code. Also, the classroom environment in online school is pretty dull. When going through my classes, I feel that I am just waiting for the class to end the second I join. I don’t know why I feel this, it just doesn’t seem like school. Furthermore, this results in students not paying attention and having little motivation. For example, when in my zoom classes those 2 weeks, I could obviously see my classmates looking off into the distance or using their computer for other activities. Also, I experienced a lack of motivation and also my friend Harry did too. During history class one day, we were texting about how difficult it was in online school to have motivation as school just isn’t the same as you are learning off of asynchronous assignments. I am not sure there is much of a solution to his problem as it is extremely difficult to convey classes similar to in=person when online, so maybe in the future, software will develop and will somehow make class interactive as if we were there with something like VR. Another problem with online school is the little social interaction that you get from it. All I get to do with my friends during the day in online school is facetime them, or meet up with them once a week to get lunch. One of the best parts of school is seeing my friends, so to have this taken away from me and all of the other students at HM is terrible. The solution to this would rely upon the students and setting their schedules to see their closer friends, but that is really difficult, while at school it is so simple. Lastly, tons of people have issues with either their wifi, their computer, their home environment, etc. As a result, online school is even more difficult for them. If their wifi or computer can’t run zoom well, they are not going to be able to learn and participate in zoom at all. Also, if their home environment isn’t great for online school it could stop them from participating, turning on their camera, and their learning experience as they have to deal with issues at home. The issues of online school are pretty significant, and influential on our education at HM, but it is all for the safety of our student body and our faculty.
For the lab, I worked with Nick to obtain the observations in-person, but at home I did the observations alone while I was in zoom classes. In order to sort my observations, I used the AEIOU format which was extremely effective for me as it gave me a foundation for sorting my observations that fit pretty well with most of my observations. I thought that online, this lab wasn’t great as focusing in class there is already difficult, so having another task like this kind of slips out of your thought. But, I liked the day in which we had to walk around the campus and make observations as it helped me get more ideas for this write-up. From this lab, I learned that in building a mobile app for this class, their are going to be a ton of problems in creating the app which you are going to have to acknowledge, and you are going to have to figure out how to fix them as a team which is an important part of the design process.
