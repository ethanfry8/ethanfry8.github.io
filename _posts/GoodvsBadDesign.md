# GoodvsBadDesign HW

  In this post, I am going to be talking about well designed elevator buttons vs. poorly designed elevator buttons.

In these poorly designed buttons, the mapping is very bad, as it the up and down arrows don't coordinate with the buttons as they should be. If that were so, they would instead be either above or below each arrow.
Furthermore, the up button could either be to the left or above where the arrow is, making it extremely unclear which button is which, and that is the same with the down arrow.
Hence, the signifiers are really unclear in this design.
The feedback that would be recieved would be several errors being made by people clicking the buttons, and not knowing wheter they are going to go down or up, therefore wasting their time because of a design flaw.

In these well-desinged buttons, although they have the same goal of getting someone to go either up or down in an elevator, this one is much better. 
In this photo of the two buttons, the mapping is already much better because the arrows don't even coordinate with a button, but are a button within themselves, making it clear of which one to press to go wherever you want.
Furthermore, the signifiers are really, really clear in this deign as one arrow and buttons means up, and vice versa. 
In the end, the feedback is much better in this second design because it results in the person always getting the right result, unless they make an error, and it is not the design.
Lastly, the affordance(not sure if I used this right) in this design is much better as it is clear to click down on the button to go. 
But, in the bad design that is much less clear as you do know when to click down but not where the buttons take you.
